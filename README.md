<h3> 👨‍🦱 A bit about me <h3>
<h5> Hi! I'm Sam, a freshly graduated alumni of computer games design. Currently, I'm an aspiring QA Tester, looking to get a foothold in the industry. While my taste in video games varies, my interests as a designer are in compelling co-operative experiences, or laid back single player sandboxes.<h5>
  
<h3> 🤔 What's Sam up to? <h3>
<h5> Right now I'm working on refurbishing an old University project of mine, Smithy, a single player sandbox about managing a blacksmithing shop in a medieval feudal world. <h5>
  
<h3> 🎮 Games I'm playing <h3>
  
<h5> When I'm not making video games, I'm all about playing them too! Here's a few that have been taking up my time recently <h5>

<h6> Supergiant Games (2018) Hades <h6>
<h6> Obsidian Entertainment (2010) Fallout: New Vegas <h6>
<h6> Square Enix (2013) Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn <h6>
  
<h3> 📘🎧 Other Interests <h3>

<h5> Outside of gaming, I always make time to read. Currently I'm working my way through James Clavell's Shogun (1975). <h5>
<h5> I'm also an avid fan of music! Just like with video games, I keep an open mind and explore a wide selection of genres. <h5>
