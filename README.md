<h1> 👋 Hello, I'm Sam! <h1>

<h3> 👨‍🦱 A bit about me <h3>
<h5> Hi! I'm Sam, a freshly graduated alumni of computer games design. Currently, I'm an aspiring QA Tester, looking to get a foothold in the industry. While my taste in video games varies, my interests as a designer are in compelling co-operative experiences, or laid back single player sandboxes.<h5>
  
<h3> 🤔 What's Sam up to? <h3>
<h5> Right now I'm working on refurbishing an old University project of mine, Smithy, a single player sandbox about managing a blacksmithing shop in a medieval feudal world. <h5>
  
<h3> 🎮 Games I'm playing <h3>
  
<h5> When I'm not making video games, I'm all about playing them too! Here's a few that have been taking up my time recently <h5>

Supergiant Games (*2018*) Hades
Obsidian Entertainment (*2010*) Fallout: New Vegas
Square Enix (*2013*) Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn
